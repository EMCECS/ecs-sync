NOTICE file for engineering.clientside:throttle

This product includes software developed at Client-Side Engineering (https://github.com/client-side/throttle).

The Throttle related classes in this project are a direct derivative of the RateLimiter class from
 the Google Guava project. The Google Guava project license is carried over to this project.

Changes from the original include:
1. Nanosecond instead of microsecond accuracy.
2. Factoring out an interface class (Throttle.java) from the base abstract class.
3. Remove the need for any non-core-Java classes outside of the original RateLimiter and SmoothRateLimiter classes.
4. Remove the need for a SleepingStopwatch or similar class instance.
5. Use of volatile variables to prevent stale reads under concurrent access.

Here is a copy of the original copyright also listed at the top of each derivative class.
